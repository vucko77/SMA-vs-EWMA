# SMA-vs-EWMA
# Title: Validation of Simple Moving Averages and Exponential Weighted Moving Averages for analysing Acute Chronic Workload Ratios using correlation and similarity measures in professional football


To determine the most effective method for analyzing time series data concerning the Acute Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR), this study explored correlations between the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) over a 7/28-day period using a decay factor (λ). Our analysis included five GPS metrics: Total Distance, Distance in Speed Zones 3+4+5 (>19,9 km/h), High Metabolic Load Distance, Accelerations , and Decelerations, gathered from 22 players across 47 days—excluding the initial 28 days, totaling 596 data points per pair [SMA/EWMA].
